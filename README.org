#+title: Doom Kyoto Night

A dark, elegant, and easy on the eyes Neovim / Vim theme, based on Tokyo Night
color palette

This theme's code is based on [[https://github.com/MArpogaus/base16-doom][base16-doom]] and color palette comes from
[[https://github.com/shrikecode/kyotonight.vim][kyotonight.vim]]

The goal here is to make it as close to the Vim theme as possible. Currently
theme is in alpha stage and awaits more tests by yours truly.
